        <h1>About</h1>
        <div id="about-text">Edstrom Prototype, LLC is located in Holland, MI and was founded in 2003. With previous
            experience in automotive product development, the owner saw the value of a critical step sometimes missed in
            the product development process- a good prototype! Good designers, engineers and managers will tell you that
            a prototype is the best way to evaluate the design of a new product and its related parts. Attributes such
            as quality of fit, function and finish are checked and can be refined before the product is actually
            manufactured. If this step is skipped, unforeseen problems will likely surface later in production,
            requiring a much higher cost to correct. Re-cutting production tools, revamping manufacturing processes and
            scrapping parts all carry a heavy price tag. Unnecessary headaches, bad customer relations, and higher
            stress levels often result as deadlines quickly approach. Some claim that there just isn’t enough time or
            budget for a prototype, but then they pay a much higher price later. Or, limited in-house or outside sources
            prevent companies from seeing the benefits of this crucial step. Edstrom Prototype was created to meet this
            need head-on. We specialize in prototype CNC machining. Much research was done to select cutting edge
            software and machinery adaptable to the fast-paced world of prototyping. Values such as fair pricing,
            outstanding customer service, and a commitment to follow through on what we promised are the guiding
            principals of the company.</div>
